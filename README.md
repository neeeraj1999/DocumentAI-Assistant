# DocumentAI-Assistant
## üìö Overview
DocumentAI-Assistant represents a cutting-edge document interaction system that revolutionizes how users engage with PDF documents. Powered by AWS Bedrock's advanced AI capabilities, specifically utilizing Claude V2 for natural language processing and Titan for embeddings, the system implements Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to enable intuitive document analysis. When users upload PDFs, the system intelligently processes them by breaking content into meaningful chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing them in a FAISS index within AWS S3. This sophisticated architecture allows users to ask natural language questions about their documents and receive contextually accurate responses.y combining state-of-the-art AI models with efficient vector storage and retrieval mechanisms, DocumentAI-Assistant transforms static PDF documents into interactive knowledge bases, making information extraction and document analysis more accessible and efficient than ever before.
